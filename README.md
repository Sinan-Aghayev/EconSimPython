# EconSimPython

EconSimPython is a simulation project designed to model economic interactions between individuals in a simplified environment. It focuses on the dynamics of supply and demand, service pricing, and the balance of individuals over time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Economic Simulation**: Models the economic interactions between individuals, tracking variables such as balance, service price, demand, and supply.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Provides real-time graphs to visualize the changes in people's balance, service price, demand, and supply throughout the simulation.
- **Adaptive AI**: Includes an AI character whose decision-making parameters adapt over time based on economic conditions.
- **Interactive Control**: Allows users to interact with the simulation in real-time using keyboard inputs to visualize different aspects of the economy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib for graphing
- Other Python libraries as required (full list in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EconSimPython.git`

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   `cd EconSimPython`

3. Install the required Python packages:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Simulation

To start the simulation, run the `main.py` script:

`python main.py`

## Usage

Once the simulation starts, it will automatically proceed through each day, updating and displaying the economic variables in real-time. You can play with the values in "constants.py" file under "data_types" folder to see how the simulation changes.

Some keyboard functions are:

    V: Visualize the simulation
    B: Run simulation without graphics
